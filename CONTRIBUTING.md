## Code Style Guidelines

### Kotlin
- Use `camelCase` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Prefer immutability (`val` over `var`)
- Use meaningful names over comments

### XML Layouts
- Use `snake_case` for IDs
- Extract strings to `strings.xml`
- Extract dimensions to `dimens.xml`
- Follow Material Design guidelines

### Architecture
- Follow MVVM pattern
- Keep Activities/Fragments lean
- Business logic in ViewModels
- Data operations in Repositories
- Use coroutines for async operations

## Testing

- Write unit tests for ViewModels and business logic
- Use mock objects for dependencies
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for >70% code coverage

## Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Update screenshots if UI changes

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one review
2. CI checks must pass
